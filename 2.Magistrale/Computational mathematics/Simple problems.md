## Function

Given an input space $x$ and an output space $y$, $x,y\in \mathbf{R}$, a *function* $f:\mathbf{R}\to \mathbf{R}$, maps the input $x$ to the output $y$, such that $f(x)=y$. 
The function is defined for real values of the input and the output.
The graph of the function is the set of point :$$gr(f)=\{(f(x),x):x\in \mathbf{R}\}\subset \mathbf{R^2}$$
The *image* of the function (also known as the *range*) is the set of  $y$ values for which there exists an $x$ such that $y=f(x)y = f(x)y=f(x)$. 
In simpler terms, it is the set of all possible output values the function can produce.
This is the projection of the graph $gr(f)$ onto the output space, also called the co-domain.

The level set at value $v$, denoted as $L(f, v)$, is the set of all $x$ values for which $f(x)=vf(x) = vf(x)=v$. 
In other words, it is the set of input values that give the same output $v$.

For example, the **roots** of a function are a specific level set where $f(x)=0$. This is called the level set at value 0.
