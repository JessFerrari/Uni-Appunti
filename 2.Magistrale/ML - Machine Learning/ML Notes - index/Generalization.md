## Generalization

Generalize mean give the right result with a model over new data.
We can't generalize if we haven't a bias.

We can see if our model is able to generalize using the ***test set***. (See the [[Statistical Learning Theory - Vapnik]])


### Complexity 

A model that is too simple cannot representing  the target function and it's possible to make underfitting. If a model is too complex it's possible to do overfitting.
