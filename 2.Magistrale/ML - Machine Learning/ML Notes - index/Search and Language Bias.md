## Language and search bias
---

We can distinguish two type of biases: language and search bias. 

Language bias limits the Hypothesis Space $H$. It's done by defining constraints ore rules beforehand, that excluding some possibility.
If it's too restrictive it can happen to exclude the true target function 

Search bias limits the search of the right hypothesis inside the Hypothesis Space $H$. Search bias uses an incomplete search strategy to explore $H$. It relies on strategy like [[Optimization Algorithms]] to find good solution within a vast hypothesis space.
