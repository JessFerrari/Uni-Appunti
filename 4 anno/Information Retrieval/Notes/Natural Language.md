In [[Information retrieval]] we use documents and queries. The lasts can be keywords or can be written in natural language. Documents can be every thing such as natural language text, videos, imagines, ecc...

If we talk about natural language we consider query and documents a multiset of terms from a fixed vocabulary. In this way we can represent documents and queries as [[Vector space model|vectors]] in a space that has many dimensions as the terms that there are in the vocabulary and where each dimension records the frequency of the corresponding term in that document or query. 
than we [[Weighting Models|weight]] each dimension to reflect its importance.
