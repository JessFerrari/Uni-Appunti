A convex optimization problem is one in which the objective and constraints function are convex, which means they satisfy the inequality:
$$f_{i}(\alpha x+\beta y)\leq \alpha f_{i}(x)+\beta f_{i}(y)$$
for all $x,y\in\mathbf{R}^n$ and all $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbf{R}$ with 
- $\alpha+\beta=1$,
- $\alpha\geq 0$,
- $\beta\geq 0$


Convexity is more general than [[Linear program|linearity]] .
